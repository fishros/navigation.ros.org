msgid "Nav2 is the professionally supported spiritual successor of the ROS Navigation Stack. This project seeks to find a safe way to have a mobile robot move to complete complex tasks through many types of environments and classes of robot kinematics. Not only can it move from Point A to Point B, but it can have intermediary poses, and represent other types of tasks like object following and more. Nav2 is a production-grade and high-quality navigation framework trusted by 50+ companies worldwide."

msgid "It provides perception, planning, control, localization, visualization, and much more to build highly reliable autonomous systems. This will complete environmental modeling from sensor data, dynamic path planning, compute velocities for motors, avoid obstacles, represent semantic regions and objects, and structure higher-level robot behaviors. To learn more about this project, such as related projects, robots using, ROS1 comparison, and maintainers, see :ref:`about`. To learn more about navigation and ROS concepts, see :ref:`concepts`."

msgid "Nav2 uses behavior trees to create customized and intelligent navigation behavior via orchestrating many independent modular servers. A task server can be used to compute a path, control effort, recovery, or any other navigation related task. These separate servers communicate with the behavior tree (BT) over a ROS interface such as an action server or service. A robot may utilize potentially many different behavior trees to allow a robot to perform many types of unique tasks."

msgid "The diagram below will give you a good first-look at the structure of Nav2. Note: It is possible to have multiple plugins for controllers, planners, and recoveries in each of their servers with matching BT plugins. This can be used to create contextual navigation behaviors. If you would like to see a comparison between this project and ROS (1) Navigation, see :ref:`ros1_comparison`."

msgid "The expected inputs to Nav2 are TF transformations conforming to REP-105, a map source if utilizing the Static Costmap Layer, a BT XML file, and any relevant sensor data sources. It will then provide valid velocity commands for the motors of a holonomic or non-holonomic robot to follow. We currently support all of the major robot types: holonomic, differential-drive, legged, and ackermann (car-like) base types! We support them uniquely with both circular and arbitrarily-shaped robots for SE2 collision checking."
