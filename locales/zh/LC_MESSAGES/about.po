msgid "Navigation is a community effort to lower the barrier of entry of mobile robotics technology for all. This project is one of the flagship projects along with MoveIt that acts as an applications entry point and frameworks for ROS. Navigation in ROS 2 builds on the wild success of the original Navigation Stack (Nav Stack) in ROS (1). This project has been used by researchers, educators, and industry for over 10 years. There are very few projects that have lasted as long or were as successful as ROS (1) Navigation. We would like to thank David Lu!! and Mike Ferguson for their tireless over the span of a decade to keep the Nav Stack alive and well. Without their hard work, this project would not have been able to happen. If you're interested in a comparison between ROS 1 Navigation and ROS 2 Navigation, see :ref:`ros1_comparison`. For a list of robots using Navigation2, see :ref:`robots`."

msgid "Aslas, as time moves on, so must we. ROS (1) had a great run and those of us that build projects using it will remember it fondly(ish). With change comes possibilities. Navigation2 builds on the success but redesigns the framework to be more flexible and the feedback gathered over 10 years."

We would like to thank here our current and past contributors and maintainers."

msgid "``move_base`` has been split into multiple components. Rather than a single monolithic state machine, navigation 2 makes use of action servers and ROS 2's low-latency, reliable communication to separate ideas. A behavior tree is used to orchestrate these tasks. This allows Navigation2 to have highly configurable navigation behavior without programming by rearranging tasks in a behavior tree xml file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about/ros1_comparison.rst:12
msgid "The *nav2_bt_navigator* replaces ``move_base`` at the top level, with an *Action* interface to complete a navigation task with a tree-based action model. It uses *Behavior Trees* to make it possible to have more complex state machines and to add in behaviors as additional *Action Servers*. These behavior trees are configurable XMLs and we provide several starting examples."

All 4 servers can host many plugins of many algorithms each and individually called from the navigation behavior tree for specific behaviors. These servers are called from the BT navigator through their action servers to compute a result or complete a task. The state is maintained by the BT navigator behavior tree."
