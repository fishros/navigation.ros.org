Now, we can make use of multi-threaded spinners, callback groups, and individual executors for specific tasks."

We currently have a test coverage rate of 85% and do full system simulations in Continuous Integration (CI) to test the entire navigation system with a real robot completing real navigation tasks. Your task will be to increase the testing coverage rate to 90% (or +5% from your starting) and improve on the existing system tests to represent a more realistic environment. You will then work to make sure of that environment to actively block the robot from completing its task to simulate worst-case conditions."
