msgid "In mobile robot and autonomous vehicle navigation, there are situations where a human driver is required to intervene to get the vehicle out of a sticky situation. This can be both as a backup in case of autonomy failure as well as the primary function of the robot (e.g. telepresence robots)."

msgid "This project's aim is to create an assisted teleop feature in Nav2 by means of a new behavior tree configuration file (the file that defines the flow of information for the navigation task) and potentially new plugins. This feature should make sure to use the local costmap and/or sensor data in order to avoid obstacles and take position and/or velocity commands to attempt to follow."
msgstr "该项目的目标是通过引入新的行为树配置文件（定义导航任务信息流的文件）和可能的新插件，在Nav2中创建一个辅助遥控功能。该功能应确保使用本地代价地图和/或传感器数据以避开障碍物，并采用位置和/或速度命令来尝试跟随。"

msgstr "In order for nav2 to leverage this the best, we need to adjust our usage of ROS 2 nodes and executors to further minimize the number of node objects in existance. In the early days of ROS 2 when Nav2 was being built, we were required to have many nodes in a single server in order to handle action requests and other callbacks. Now, we can make use of multi-threaded spinners, callback groups, and individual executors for specific tasks."

Additionally, the behavior tree plugins should be updated to leverage callback groups to ensure that any single BT node spinning to check if any new messages are on its callback will **only** trigger its own callback by the same mechanisms."
